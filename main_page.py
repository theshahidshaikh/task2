        #### About Dataset
        This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.
        This dataset consists of about 26K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 11 different classes.
        A new directory containing 14 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
        #### Content
        1. train (20815 images)
        2. test (14 images)
        3. validation (5203 images)
